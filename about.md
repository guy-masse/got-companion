I am a beginner at this boardgame. But having lost 'incredibly' bad to it more than once, I taught I should put my development skills to the test and built a nice tool to help me out beat my friends!

This simple tools should provide recommendation on your plays given the current state of a game. I would also like to have different strategies implemented as to provide directed advices towards specific goals: mustering, consolidating power, etc.

If you do not own this game yet, go run and buy it. It is a great boardgame. And if you like the [books] [george_books] or the [tv show] [hbo_got], you will find lots of similarities.
